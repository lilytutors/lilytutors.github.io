    <p>If you don't see your subject listed above, don't worry! I also offer tutoring in various levels of science,
        English, computer science, and more. Please <a href="./contact.html">reach out</a> with any inquiries about
        available subjects.</p>

    <p>I offer both in-person and virtual tutoring. In-person tutoring is typically done in the Yale Sterling Memorial
        Library, which is located in New Haven, Connecticut, and is open to the public. Exceptions to
        this meeting location would include piano lessons, for example. If the student cannot come to
        Yale's library for any reason, I may be able to meet at a nearby location. Zoom or a similar platform is used
        for virtual sessions.</p>

    <p>My standard rate includes the lesson itself, plus outside-of-session help (emailed questions from students and/or parents, essay editing, sample problem creation,and the like). Group lessons and in-person lessons at an off-campus location will have modified rates accordingly. For specific questions regarding pricing, please <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
