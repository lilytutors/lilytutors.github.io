        <p>"Lily demonstrated how to write a short summary and response, and helped me finish my assignment. Just one
            lesson taught me quite a few things, and I feel more confident about my writing skills. It was appreciated
            that she accommodated my schedule on such short notice." - Vivian, English as a Second Language
