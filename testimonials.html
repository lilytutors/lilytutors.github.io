        "My experience with Lily was great! she is very patient and makes sure you really understand how to do the
        problems. If you don't understand the problem, she'll personalize it by giving examples more suited towards you
        that'll help click in your head. All in all, she's a very sweet and intelligent person, and I look forward to
        working with her again." - Juan, Probability and Statistics

        "Thank you so much for tutoring me this year for AP Music Theory! This was my first time having a tutor and I'm
        glad I had you. You have helped me so much and I would not have gotten through this year without you. Thank you
        for your support and encouragement when I needed it. I really appreciate it!" - Sarah, AP Music Theory

    <p>"Lily demonstrated how to write a short summary and response, and helped me finish my assignment. Just one
        lesson taught me quite a few things, and I feel more confident about my writing skills. It was appreciated
        that she accommodated my schedule on such short notice." - Vivian, English as a Second Language
