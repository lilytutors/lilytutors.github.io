    <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
        I have 7+ years of experience tutoring across a wide <b>range of subjects and student ages</b>. I have always
        loved <b>learning and helping people</b>, so tutoring became a natural passion of mine. Over time, I have honed
        my ability to <b>tailor lessons</b> to each student's <b>unique learning style</b> and needs. Ultimately, my
        goal is to provide <b>personalized tutoring</b> that gives a <b>complete understanding</b> of the material. I
        believe that this way of learning, instead of rote memorization, makes the content <b>enjoyable and
            applicable</b> to future courses, tasks, or assessments.</p>
    <p>
        If you're looking for a <b>dedicated, experienced tutor</b>, please <a href="./contact.html">reach out</a> to
        schedule a lesson! Additionally, you can read some of my current and past students' <a
            href="./testimonials.html">reviews here</a>. I look forward to working with you!</p>

    <h3>Education and Experience</h3>
    <p>
        I am an undergraduate at <b>Yale University</b>, where I study <b>Applied Mathematics and French</b>. I tutor
        for two calculus courses and serve as an <b>academic coach</b> for a summer program geared towards incoming
        freshmen who need extra preparation for college-level math. I have also continued to tutor privately, while
        managing a full courseload, holding <b>leadership</b> in clubs, participating in <b>study abroad</b>
        experiences, and gaining <b>research</b> experience in cognitive science, machine learning, and neural networks.
    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated as the <b>valedictorian</b> of my high school and earned national recognized as a <b>2021 US
            Presidential Scholar</b>. As the <b>president of National
            Honor Society</b>, I tutored middle school students and high school peers in math, science, and French, and
        I oversaw various <b>learning initiatives</b> in the community, such as <b>book drives and tutoring programs</b>. I
        also taught young children how to read through the <b>AmeriCorps non-profit Reading Partners</b>, volunteered as
        a tutor in local community centers, taught individual <b>piano lessons</b>, helped students prepare for the
        <b>SAT/ACT</b>, and reviewed <b>college application</b> essays (including for a <b>Harvard-bound student</b>).
